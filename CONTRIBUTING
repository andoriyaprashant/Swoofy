# Welcome to Swoofy docs contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Getting started

If you want to contribute to our project, and don't know where to start, you can look at the issues labeled [good first issue](https://github.com/andoriyaprashant/Swoofy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), which will be a good entry point, to interact with the codebase, while helping the project forward.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you have experienced a bug when using our project, or when wondering around in the code base, you can submit a [detailed Bug Report](https://github.com/andoriyaprashant/Swoofy/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=). This will centralize the information about issues encountered by everyone, and  simplify our work to solve those issues :wink:

If you really really want a new feature to be included in our project, you can submit a [detailed issue about it](https://github.com/andoriyaprashant/Swoofy/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=). Those requests will be review and prioritized by the contributors.
*Note: if a feature request is already existing for the topic you have in mind, feel free to comment, and react to it. It will make the priorization easier for us, by focusing on the most requested one*

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/andoriyaprashant/Swoofy/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Description" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada: The Swoofy team thanks you :sparkles:.
